The First Knight, an orphan raised under the guidance of the Light Church - one who had dedicated his entire life and existence to serving the light.
Due to accidentally reading ancient ruins in a secret room of the Church, that harsh secret transformed him into a heretic. He had to flee and confront his own brothers.
Later, Kane coerces Kieron to rescue him and reluctantly becomes Kieron's highly unstable teammate.
