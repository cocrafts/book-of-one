## Design Notes
- Elias should evoke both sympathy and unease; readers should admire his conviction while questioning his methods
- His relationship with Serina should be understated but powerful, showing his capacity for deep feeling despite his outward stoicism
- As the story progresses, small moments of vulnerability should contrast with his growing power
- His ultimate arc is learning that sacrifice doesn't always mean giving up happiness, but sometimes means accepting it when offered
