## Tiberius Frost

The current king of the Typhoon Kingdom, the central kingdom of the ATEM continent - a nation that has led the human alliance to rise over thousands of years.
However, due to a covenant that the Typhoon royal family would not control the army, the Typhoon royalty gradually lost their dominance, influence, and power - The Central Army is virtually a state within a state, and an Emperor inside the Typhoon Kingdom itself. They abuse their power across the continent, causing allied nations to become dissatisfied with both the Army and the Central Typhoon Kingdom, which had led them throughout history.
Tiberius is no ordinary king. He is the hope of the Typhoon Kingdom; his father placed his faith in restoration and his last forces in Tiberius - however, the kingdom has been too weakened for Tiberius to maneuver easily. Moreover, the rise and somewhat hostile influence of the Light Church forms a tight grip around the Frost family.
Nevertheless, the old king Tiberius is an unpredictable figure; no one dares underestimate his will and power. The power struggle has shifted to the genius Prince Alaric, one of his sons. The Central Army and the Light Church, despite not being particularly fond of each other, have allied to suppress Alaric.

## Alaric Frost: fallen genius

Inheriting the battle energy power of the Frost family as well as the wisdom of his father King Tiberius, Alaric is a character full of ability and moral character.
Tiberius almost believed that Alaric would be the one to complete the family and Empire's restoration in his place, something that no one could prevent - however, that expectation quickly collapsed when Alaric became entangled in a romantic relationship with the Divine Maiden of the Light Church, a taboo for both Tiberius and the Light Church. They quickly tried to strongly prevent this relationship but failed.
Alaric was a brave and determined young man; nothing could stop him from pursuing the love of his life. With power equivalent to a Holy Knight, dual-system Magic level 9 - Alaric could hardly find an opponent, but he did not anticipate the hidden power behind the Light Church. It came from a forgotten ancient history, beyond the understanding and imagination of the young man.
Despite Alaric being the Crown Prince of the Typhoon Kingdom, the Light Church declared a hunt for Alaric, who had defiled and impregnated the Divine Maiden of the Light Church. Tiberius, although initially strongly opposed, quickly confronted the Church, and the two leading powers of ATEM clashed. The Central Army, which should have obeyed their sovereign, subtly ignored and secretly cooperated with the Light Church. Tiberius was helpless to watch his son being hunted without being able to help much. The kings and long-standing allied families of Typhoon also maintained an unusually silent attitude.
After years in hiding, Alaric and the Divine Maiden were surrounded and faced with the elite forces of the Light Church and mysterious strangers. Their battle lasted many days, with victory belonging to the Church side. The Divine Maiden committed suicide to atone, in exchange for the Church's promise to leave her and Alaric's child alone.
Tiberius also had to face enormous pressure from the Church and mysterious strangers - beings with an ancient breath whose existence he may have known. Tiberius had to vow to imprison his son Alaric in eternal darkness, as long as his grandson wanted to live a peaceful life. His father would have to abandon the political stage, as well as the ability to inherit the throne, and Alaric's son, Tiberius's grandson, would never be allowed to access battle energy or royal power.
For Tiberius, it was the end of the Frost family - the Typhoon kingdom would end bitterly in his hands, which was exactly what the powers in the light and shadows across the ATEM continent wanted.

## Kieron Frost: the lonely apprentice

Kieron Frost grew up under strict supervision from both the Church and the Central Army, with few people knowing about him, a lonely person. Tiberius was always a strict grandfather. Kieron resembled his father exactly, someone who always reminded Tiberius of painful memories. The two had few opportunities to talk or interact with each other.
By the age of 12, Kieron had already gotten into trouble with the Light Church when he tried to understand his existence. Master Alfwyn took him as a student in the field of pharmaceuticals and declared protection for him until he turned 18. He promised not to teach battle energy to this student as per the covenant of the previous generation.
Kieron was a bright, lively child whose isolated childhood and the story of the previous generation did not seem to affect him much. At least that was what people saw on the surface.
Perhaps only his teacher, Master Alfwyn, truly understood what kind of boy this young man was. How could the son of Alaric and grandson of Tiberius be an ordinary child? Carefree and thoughtless, how could old Tiberius, no matter how secretive, deceive this old friend?
No one knows what secrets Tiberius and the Frost family hold. A family once among the most glorious in human history, even in decline, cannot be casually underestimated.
Everyone in this grandfather-grandson household is dangerous, and Alfwyn himself got involved in this matter with no other choice.
