## Magical Order:

ATEM is a magical world, in which Dark Magic and Light Magic are the two supreme types of magic possessed by the Evil tribe (Dark Magic) and Angel tribe (Light Magic).
Dark and Light belong to the Prime Magic group. Although very difficult, they can be combined to create its "primitive" form: Prime Magic.
Additionally, there is the Elf tribe who possess 5 types of Magic: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth - combining these types together creates the "primitive" form: Elemental Magic.

In history, it is vaguely recounted that there was once a pair of Evil and Angel lovers who combined to create the "Prime Magic" form.
In contrast, 5 Elf elders combined the 5 types of Magic to achieve the "Prime Magic" form.
The Evil race is an ambitious species that wants to impose its will on other races. Being at the top of the power chain on the ATEM continent, Evil has enslaved other races to serve them.

Meanwhile, Angels only want their own peace. They do not consider other races to be of equal status, including the Evil tribe.
Angels took over the land they call High Heaven and isolated themselves from the surrounding world.
The Elves are friendlier; they care about nature and teach their Elemental Magic to other races.
Therefore, besides Evil, Angel, and Elf, other races gradually learned magic (usually one system in Elemental, however occasionally there are exceptional individuals who can master 2 systems in Elemental Magic).

Humans are a special race; they cannot sense magic or learn it. Therefore, Humans' position is the lowest in the power chain of ATEM.
Because of this, the Elves broke their rule to teach Humans their special technique, the ability to bless weapons by drawing magical patterns. Also because of this skill, humans became slaves forging weapons and creating for Evil along with the Dwarf tribe.

The Dwarf tribe has a stronger natural talent compared to humans in crafting skills, yet they are more honest, simpler, and do not have the ability to enchant weapons with magical patterns.

## The Rise of Humans:

Although they are the only race that does not possess magic, humans are numerous and highly competitive - they do not want to be enslaved and stand at the end of the food chain.

They planned over many generations to become a loyal and useful force to Evil to elevate their status - and they proposed the Ex-Calibur plan, to create the ultimate weapon.

To help Evil create a decisive difference to invade Angel territory. With support from Evil, Dwarves and Humans forged and enchanted 7 sacred artifacts.
The combination of 7 artifacts forms Ex-Calibur, the ultimate weapon that can destroy both Evil and Angel. Humans suddenly betrayed Evil and allied with other races to rise up.

Since most of Ex-Calibur's power is provided by Prime Magic, humans cannot use it to kill Evil - they can only seal Evil away, the sealing place later called the Under Realm.

After sealing Evil, Humans proposed a peace treaty with other races across the ATEM continent, peace lasting hundreds of years.
But that was just the calm before the storm; Humans never wanted peace - they wanted to dominate this continent, a species without magic would become the lord, the head of the food chain!

Humans quickly found a reason to war with Angels, a race that had been very wary, suspicious, and cautious with Humans after their rise.
Angels counterattacked strongly, almost overwhelming Humans. However, humans quickly established an army, combining magical weapons, teamwork fighting ability, iron discipline, things that the Angel race did not have (they fought freely and individually). Humans gradually regained the advantage and sealed Angels as they had done with Evil.

Due to preparation, Angels were not completely sealed; some Angels left the High Heaven land and hid in a secret land.

## No-magic era
Not stopping with Angels, Humans approached their teachers, the Elf tribe - those who had taught them survival skills.

The Elves are a race with self-esteem; they value promises, so instead of war, Humans promised that they would leave Elves alone if they accepted the condition to permanently stay in "The Dark Forest" without trespassing into "the human world" (actually the land that previously belonged to the 3 races: Evil, Angel, Elf).
The Elves, though unwilling, were forced to agree and had to isolate themselves from the ATEM continent, from the remaining history of the world.
With this, the position of Humans was reset. They decided to ban magic throughout the continent - something they could not possess.
Over thousands of years, Humans have destroyed other races and become the only species allowed to speak up.

## Under Realm

Today, the human world is a world of nations, armies, iron, and muscle. People do not know about the existence of magic, which has been buried by history.
