# Chapter 2: Apprentice and the Knight

The blizzard came without warning, as they often did in the Ice Forest. One moment, the sky above the pine canopy was clear and star-filled; the next, a wall of white descended, erasing the world beyond arm's reach.

Kieron Frost pulled his fur-lined hood tighter, squinting against the onslaught of ice and wind. He had fallen behind Master Alfwyn only moments ago, distracted by a curious pattern of frost forming unnaturally on a fallen log—the kind of phenomenon his master had taught him to observe, for in such small magics did greater truths reveal themselves.

"Master Alfwyn!" he called, his voice swallowed by the howling gale. 

No answer came. The forest, so familiar to him after three years as Alfwyn the Gray's apprentice, had transformed into an alien landscape of shadow and snow.

Kieron steadied himself against a frost-covered trunk, reaching into his pocket for the smooth stone his master had given him—a lodestone that would help him find north when visibility failed. As he concentrated on the subtle pull of the stone, a sound reached him through the storm—not the wind, but something sharper. Metal against metal, followed by a cry of pain.

Caution warred with curiosity in the young apprentice's mind. Master Alfwyn had warned him repeatedly about the dangers lurking in the deeper reaches of the Ice Forest, particularly now, when rumors spoke of increased Central Army patrols and Light Church activity. But the cry that followed—desperate and weakening—made the decision for him.

Kieron moved carefully through the trees, his footfalls silent as Master Alfwyn had taught him. The storm provided cover, but also blinded him to potential danger. He crested a small rise and dropped immediately to his stomach, peering over.

In the hollow below, barely visible through the swirling snow, a man in tattered golden armor lay propped against a tree. Blood—oddly luminescent in the dim light—seeped from a wound in his side. Around him, the snow had melted in a perfect circle, as though the very cold of the forest dared not touch him.

Kieron had never seen battle energy manifest in such a way. The stories told of great warriors whose đấu khí could warm the air around them, but this was different. This was... something else. Something ancient.

The wounded man's head snapped up, and despite the distance and storm between them, Kieron felt the intensity of his gaze lock onto him with impossible precision. His hand moved to the hilt of a dagger at his belt.

"I see you, boy," the man called, his voice carrying unnaturally through the howling wind. "Stand where you are." His eyes, fever-bright yet calculating, assessed Kieron with cold efficiency. "I've killed men for less than stumbling upon my hiding place. Your life now hangs on your next decision—help me reach shelter, or die here before you can alert my pursuers."

Kieron's breath caught. He recognized the remains of the armor now—the intricate patterns inscribed along the breastplate, the seven-pointed star emblazoned on the pauldrons. This was no ordinary warrior.

This was a Knight of the Light Church. And judging by the weapon clutched protectively at his side—wrapped in cloth that seemed to absorb rather than reflect the surrounding whiteness—this was the traitor everyone in the North had been warned about.

Sir Dominic Kane, the fallen First Knight.

For a moment, Kieron considered retreating, finding Master Alfwyn, alerting the Stark guards who surely patrolled nearby. But something in Kane's eyes held him in place—not malice, but a terrible certainty, a burning conviction.

"The storm grows stronger," Kane said, grimacing as he shifted position. "And those who hunt me draw closer. Make your choice, apprentice."

Kieron froze. "How did you know I'm an apprentice?"

A pained smile crossed Kane's face. "The herbs in your satchel. The way you move through the snow. And that pendant—" he nodded toward the small stone hanging from a leather cord around Kieron's neck, usually hidden beneath his clothing but now exposed by the wind, "—marks you as a student of the old ways, though you may not know it yourself."

Kieron's hand flew to the stone, a gift from Master Alfwyn on his first day of apprenticeship. The old man had called it a simple focus stone, nothing more.

Kane's gaze lingered on Kieron's pendant, something shifting in his expression. The murderous intent seemed to ebb from him like a receding tide. "You have two choices, boy," Kane continued, his voice weakening. "Help me reach the cave of ice beyond the northern ridge, or leave now and forget you saw me."

"There is a third choice," came a new voice, and Kieron spun to see three figures in gleaming armor emerging from the storm behind him. Light Church Inquisitors, their white cloaks somehow repelling the snow that clung to everything else. "The boy can help us apprehend the traitor and be rewarded for his service to the Light."

The lead Inquisitor stepped forward, his face hidden behind an ornate helmet adorned with golden rays. "Step aside, child. This man has stolen what is sacred and must answer for his crime."

Kieron remained frozen between them, his mind racing. Something was wrong here—something beyond a simple case of theft and pursuit. The way the snow avoided the Inquisitors, the strange light emanating from Kane's wound, the unnatural silence that had suddenly fallen around them all.

Kane struggled to his feet, one hand pressed to his side, the other clutching the wrapped bundle that must be the Light Spear all of ATEM had heard whispers about. "They won't let you leave, boy," he said softly. "You've seen too much already."

The Inquisitor took another step forward. "Last warning. Stand aside."

In that moment, Kieron's fingers brushed against his pendant, and he felt it grow inexplicably cold against his skin. A strange certainty washed over him, not unlike the feeling he sometimes experienced when identifying rare herbs in the forest—a knowledge that seemed to come from somewhere beyond conscious thought. 

He reached into his satchel and grabbed a handful of the silvery powder Master Alfwyn had taught him to prepare—ostensibly for treating frostbite, though the old man had hinted at other uses.

"Close your eyes!" he shouted to Kane, then flung the powder into the air between them and the Inquisitors.

The powder ignited upon contact with the falling snow, creating a blinding flash that illuminated the entire clearing with far more intensity than Kieron had expected. The Inquisitors cried out, shielding their eyes too late. In the momentary confusion, Kieron darted to Kane's side, pulling the wounded knight's arm across his shoulders.

"The cave," Kane gasped. "North and west, beyond the twisted pines."

Together they stumbled through the snow, the knight leaning heavily on the much smaller apprentice. Behind them, angry shouts pierced the renewed howl of the blizzard.

"That was no ordinary flash powder," Kane observed through gritted teeth as they pushed forward. "Your master teaches you more than herbs and remedies, it seems."

"I—I'm not certain what happened," Kieron admitted, surprised at his own actions. The decision to help Kane had felt almost instinctual, as if guided by some hidden current beneath his conscious thoughts. "The powder has never reacted that way before."

The twisted pines Kane had mentioned were landmarks known to few outside House Stark—how did this southern knight know of them? More puzzling still was how naturally Kieron's feet carried him toward them, as if he'd walked this path a hundred times before, though he was certain he hadn't.

They reached the ancient pines as the storm began to ease, the massive trees contorted by centuries of wind and magic into shapes that resembled writhing figures. Beyond them, partially hidden by an outcropping of rock, the narrow entrance to the ice cave awaited.

Inside, the temperature dropped further, but at least they were sheltered from the wind. Crystalline formations hung from the ceiling, capturing what little light filtered through the entrance and scattering it throughout the chamber in ghostly patterns. Some of the ice formations seemed to form symbols—patterns that tugged at the edges of Kieron's memory, though he was certain he had never seen them before.

Kieron helped Kane to a relatively flat section of stone and set about examining his wound. The knight hissed in pain as Kieron pulled back the torn fabric around the injury.

"This is no ordinary cut," Kieron murmured, more to himself than to Kane. The edges of the wound glowed with a pale light, and the flesh around it was not inflamed as would be expected, but rather seemed drained of all color. "What weapon did this?"

"A Light Seal," Kane replied, his breathing labored. "My former brothers have weapons designed to harm those who betray their oaths. No conventional healing will mend this wound."

Kieron rummaged in his satchel, producing small vials and pouches of herbs. "Master Alfwyn has taught me that there are few wounds beyond all healing. Let me try."

As he worked, applying poultices and quietly murmuring the focusing chants Alfwyn had taught him, Kieron felt a strange resonance between his pendant and the wrapped bundle Kane still clutched protectively. His hands moved with unexpected surety, selecting herbs and minerals he had never used in combination before, yet somehow knowing they were right for this peculiar wound.

Kane studied him through fever-bright eyes.

"You have a gift," the knight said after a time, his voice taking on a distant quality. The fever was clearly worsening; sweat beaded on Kane's forehead despite the cave's bitter cold, and his eyes had begun to lose focus. "A sensitivity to energies most cannot perceive."

Kieron shrugged uncomfortably. "Master Alfwyn says I have a knack for herbalism, nothing more."

Kane's grip on the wrapped bundle tightened convulsively as another wave of pain seemed to wash over him. He shuddered, his breathing becoming rapid and shallow. The luminous blood from his wound glowed brighter, and for a moment, Kieron thought he saw strange symbols dancing in the light it cast.

"The wound is worsening," Kieron said, reaching for more herbs. "Try to lie still."

Kane's head fell back against the stone, eyes half-closed, unfocused. "They're all... lies," he muttered, clearly no longer fully conscious. "The histories... fabricated by the victors..."

Kieron leaned closer, applying more of the poultice to the wound. "Save your strength, Sir Kane."

"Seals... weakening now..." Kane's voice had taken on the rambling quality of a man caught between waking and dreaming, words tumbling out without conscious control. "They know... your master knows..."

The knight's eyes suddenly snapped open, fever-bright and intense, but not seeing Kieron—looking instead at something far beyond. His free hand shot out, grabbing Kieron's wrist with surprising strength.

"Have you ever wondered why battle energy—đấu khí, as some call it—manifests differently in different warriors?" he demanded, his voice suddenly clearer despite his delirious state. "Why some command fire, others ice, still others the very earth itself?"

Kieron had wondered, though he'd never voiced the question. Master Alfwyn taught that different affinities were simply a matter of temperament and training. Yet in his dreams, Kieron had sometimes seen visions of power flowing like rivers of colored light through the world—dreams he had attributed to an overactive imagination.

"Not... merely... battle energy," Kane continued, his words slurring as he slipped deeper into delirium. "Remnants of true magic... Elemental Magic... Elves taught us before... before the betrayal... we betrayed them all..."

Kieron nearly dropped the bandage he was preparing. Such talk was dangerous—heretical, even. The Church of Light taught that humans had always been the sole sentient race, with other beings mere legends or metaphors.

"Sir Kane, you're delirious from the fever," Kieron said carefully, trying to ease the knight back down. "You need to rest."

But Kane's grip only tightened, his eyes seeming to clear momentarily, though his skin burned with unnatural heat. "The fever burns away the lies," he whispered, his voice suddenly taking on a quality that made Kieron's skin crawl—as if it wasn't entirely Kane speaking. "They taught us to forget. Made us forget. The Church of Light doesn't serve the Angels—they enslave what remains of them, drawing power from their imprisonment just as the First Alliance did with the Evil Ones."

A chill that had nothing to do with the cave's temperature ran down Kieron's spine. The words didn't sound like the ravings of a madman; there was a terrible coherence to them, even through the fever-induced haze.

Kane's head rolled from side to side as he continued, his words coming in feverish bursts between labored breaths. "Seven Artifacts... created together... humans, Dwarves, Elves... to combat the Evil Ones... Ex-Calibur when combined..."

He convulsed slightly, and Kieron had to hold him down to prevent him from reopening his wound. The knight's eyes rolled wildly, looking at things Kieron couldn't see.

"We perverted... their purpose," Kane gasped. "Used them to seal away... all races with power beyond our own..."

His free hand gestured weakly toward the wrapped bundle, which glowed faintly through its coverings. "Light Spear... one such artifact. Took it to... prevent misuse..." His voice dropped to a barely audible whisper. "Seals weakening... Evil Ones stir in prison... If Church regains Spear... won't strengthen seals... will extract last essence of Light Magic from Angels... before great awakening..."

As Kane spoke, Kieron felt the pendant against his chest grow warmer, pulsing in time with his quickening heartbeat. His fingertips tingled with a sensation he had experienced only a few times before—when gathering certain rare herbs under the full moon, or when wandering into parts of the Ice Forest where Master Alfwyn said the veil between worlds grew thin.

Kieron sat back on his heels, processing the knight's words. If even a fraction of what Kane said was true, the world was far different than he had been taught. And yet... hadn't Master Alfwyn hinted at such things in his most cryptic moments? Hadn't the old man's teachings about "natural energies" always seemed to skirt the edges of something deeper?

"Why tell me this?" Kieron asked finally. "I'm just an apprentice." But even as he spoke, he felt the pendant grow warm against his skin, as if in contradiction to his words.

Kane's eyes were beginning to close, the fever taking its toll. "Because you helped me when wisdom would have counseled otherwise. Because you can sense what others cannot." His voice faded to a murmur. "And because the patterns are in your blood, whether you know it or not."

Before Kieron could ask what he meant, Kane slipped into unconsciousness, his breathing shallow but steady. The apprentice finished bandaging the wound, though he doubted his conventional remedies would have much effect on whatever magic had caused it.

As he worked, a strange sensation crept over him—the feeling of being watched. He turned slowly, scanning the shadows of the cave, but saw nothing. Yet the sensation persisted, a pressure against his mind rather than his eyes.

"I know you're there, Master," he said finally, recognizing the familiar presence.

Master Alfwyn stepped from a recess in the cavern wall where no recess had been visible before. His weathered face was grim, his gray eyes sharper than Kieron had ever seen them.

"Three years as my student," the old man said softly, "and you still manage to surprise me, Kieron Frost."

"How long have you been there?" Kieron asked, embarrassment mingling with relief at his master's appearance. The pendant at his chest had grown cool again, as if responding to Alfwyn's presence.

"Long enough." Alfwyn moved to Kane's side, examining the wound with practiced eyes. "A Light Seal, as he said. Powerful magic, though they would never call it such."

"Then it's true? What he was saying about magic, about the Angels and Evil Ones?"

Alfwyn sighed deeply. "Some of it. Perhaps more than some." He straightened, fixing Kieron with a penetrating gaze. "You've walked into the pages of history, my boy. And I fear there is no walking back out."

As if in response to his words, a distant horn sounded beyond the cave entrance—the signal of Stark guards on the move. The hunt was intensifying.

"We cannot stay here," Alfwyn said, gathering Kieron's scattered supplies and returning them to his satchel. "The cave is known to House Stark, and they will search it before long."

"We can't move him," Kieron protested, gesturing to Kane. "He'll die."

"He may die regardless," Alfwyn replied, though his tone held no callousness, only resignation. "But you are my concern, not he."

The old master hesitated, then reached into his robe and removed something—a small medallion that Kieron had never seen before. In the dim light of the cave, it appeared to be a fragment of thick parchment or card, encased in crystal. Stranger still, it seemed to pulse with an inner darkness, not the absence of light but something more tangible.

"The seals are weakening sooner than expected," Alfwyn murmured, seemingly to himself.

He tucked the strange object away before Kieron could get a proper look at it, but the apprentice had seen enough to recognize that it was unlike anything in Master Alfwyn's usual collection of herbs, stones, and remedies.

"What was that?" Kieron asked.

Alfwyn's expression closed like a shuttered window. "Something you are not yet ready to understand." He moved to the cave entrance, peering out at the forest beyond. "Come. We must reach safer ground before we are discovered."

"And him?" Kieron nodded toward Kane.

Alfwyn was silent for a long moment, weighing options only he could see. Finally, he said, "We will take him with us, though it doubles our risk. There is more to his story than even he knows, I suspect."

As they prepared to move the unconscious knight, Kieron felt the weight of the day's events settling on his shoulders. He had entered the forest as an apprentice herbalist, comfortable in his understanding of the world. He would leave it as something else entirely, a participant in events beyond his imagining.

A sudden gust of wind howled at the cave entrance, causing the crystalline formations to vibrate with an almost musical tone. Kieron paused, listening. For a moment, it seemed as if the ice sang with voices—ancient voices, speaking in a language he could almost, but not quite, understand.

"Did you hear that?" he asked Master Alfwyn.

The old man's expression was unreadable. "Hear what, boy?"

"Nothing," Kieron replied after a moment. "Just the wind."

But as he helped his master prepare Kane for transport, somewhere in the back of his mind, a voice that sounded much like Kane's whispered that the patterns were in his blood, whether he knew it or not. And deeper still, another voice—older, colder, more familiar than any he had ever known—seemed to whisper, *At last.*

The first steps into ATEM's true history had been taken. There would be no turning back.
