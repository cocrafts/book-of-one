# Chapter 3: Call for Aid

The journey from the ice cave had been arduous. Kane, drifting between consciousness and fevered delirium, had grown heavier with each passing mile as Kieron and Alfwyn took turns supporting his considerable weight. They moved steadily northward through the deepening snow, toward the forbidden lands at the edge of the Ice Forest—the No-Man Valley, where even the bravest hunters of House Stark dared not venture.

"The dragons," Alfwyn had explained when Kieron questioned their destination, his voice barely audible over the howling wind. "The ancient dragons that dwell beyond the valley might be Kane's only hope."

"Dragons?" Kieron had nearly stumbled in surprise. "But they're just legends—stories to frighten children."

Alfwyn's eyes had flickered briefly to the pendant around Kieron's neck. "As is magic, to most who walk these lands. And yet here we are, carrying a man wounded by magic, bearing an artifact of power."

The night had fallen swiftly, as it always did in the northern reaches of the Ice Forest. Unable to continue in the darkness, they made camp in a small hollow sheltered by the massive roots of an ancient pine. Alfwyn had wordlessly gathered wood for a fire, and with a strange gesture and whispered word that Kieron was not meant to hear, brought flame to life despite the dampness of the forest.

It was by this fire that Kane had first truly awakened, his eyes clear for the first time since their encounter in the forest. The knight had accepted water from Kieron's waterskin, drinking deeply before speaking.

"How far have we come?" he asked, his voice rough from disuse.

"A day's journey north," Kieron replied, carefully turning a brace of snow hares on the makeshift spit above the fire. The small game had practically wandered into his snares, as if guided there by some unseen hand. "Master Alfwyn believes the dragons of No-Man Valley might be able to help with your wound."

A flicker of surprise crossed Kane's face as he glanced toward Alfwyn, who sat a short distance away, seemingly lost in meditation.

"How far is the No-Man Valley from here?" Kane asked, his voice stronger after drinking the water, eyes measuring the distance they'd need to travel.

"Another day's journey, if we push hard," Alfwyn replied, returning to the fire. "Though in your condition..." 

Kane nodded grimly. "The Church's trackers will catch us before then. And the Central Army has deployed their Hunter units—I recognized their signals before I fell." 

"You know much about our pursuers," Alfwyn observed, kneeling to check the cooking hares.

"I led many such hunts myself," Kane admitted without pride. "The Church does not forgive those who betray its secrets." His gaze shifted to Alfwyn. "Just as they have never forgotten the Gray Circle of the North."

Alfwyn's expression remained carefully neutral, but Kieron noticed his master's hands pause momentarily in their work. He had never heard of any "Gray Circle," yet another piece of Alfwyn's past that had been kept from him.

"Those days are long past," Alfwyn said simply, returning to his task.

"The Light has a long memory," Kane countered, wincing as he shifted position. "As do you, Master Herbalist... if that is truly all you are."

Kieron removed the hares from the fire, offering one to Kane while studying the exchange between the two men. It was clear they knew—or knew of—each other, though neither seemed willing to elaborate.

"The borders of the No-Man Valley are watched by House Stark," Kieron said, changing the subject to more immediate concerns. "Even if we reach it, crossing might prove difficult."

Kane accepted the offered food with a nod of thanks. "The dragons permit passage to those they deem worthy," he said between careful bites. "Or so the old texts claim."

As he spoke, Kane's eyes briefly studied Kieron with unexpected intensity. For a moment, something like recognition flickered in his gaze, but the fever seemed to cloud his thoughts before it could fully form.

"There's something in your face..." Kane murmured, then shook his head as if to clear it. "The northern lines show strongly. I once knew someone from these parts..." His voice trailed off, lost between present pain and distant memory.

Kieron kept his expression carefully neutral despite his curiosity. "We should rest while we can," he said, turning to practical matters. "The storm has covered our tracks for now, but it won't last forever."

Kane accepted the offered food with a nod of thanks. "Many who walk unusual paths begin as children who seem strange to their peers," he said, and there was something in his voice that suggested personal experience.

As they ate in silence, Kieron noticed Kane's eyes grow distant, fixed on the dancing flames. The knight had barely touched his food when a violent shudder passed through his body. The wound at his side flared with unnatural light, suddenly brighter than their campfire.

Kane collapsed without a sound, his breathing ragged and shallow. Alfwyn was at his side in an instant, pulling back the bandages to reveal veins of light now spreading across the knight's chest like branches of some ghostly tree.

"The Light Seal grows stronger," Alfwyn said grimly. "It feeds on his life force."

Throughout the night, Kane's condition deteriorated rapidly. His fever burned with impossible heat, yet his skin remained deathly pale except where the luminous tendrils spread. Kieron and Alfwyn worked in silent concert, applying poultices, brewing remedies, and cooling Kane's burning forehead with snow. The knight thrashed in delirium, occasionally gripping the wrapped Spear with such force that his knuckles turned white.

Twice, Kane stopped breathing entirely. Each time, Alfwyn placed his hands on the knight's chest and whispered words that Kieron could not quite hear but somehow understood were not ordinary healing prayers.

As dawn approached, Kane finally fell into an uneasy stillness. His breathing remained shallow, but the violent convulsions had ceased. The glowing lines beneath his skin pulsed with a steady, ominous rhythm.

Kieron, exhausted from the long night's vigil, looked up at his master with questioning eyes. "Will he survive?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Alfwyn's weathered face revealed nothing as he checked the wound one final time. "That depends on how quickly we reach the valley," he replied. "And whether our pursuers find us first."

He nodded toward the forest beyond their small shelter. "The Church's trackers are skilled, and the Central Army has deployed their best hunters. Both are approaching."

With the first pale light of dawn filtering through the trees, they prepared to move again. Kane remained unconscious as they fashioned a crude litter from pine branches and their cloaks. The Light Spear never left his side, seeming to pulse in sympathy with the glowing wound.

They traveled northward through the deepening snow, their progress painfully slow with Kane's deadweight between them. The knight did not wake, though occasionally his lips moved in silent communion with forces only he could perceive.

By mid-morning, they had reached a small clearing near the edge of the deep forest. It was here that Alfwyn paused, his keen senses detecting movement to the south and west that Kieron's younger ears could not yet perceive.

Dawn's pale fingers stretched through the snow-laden branches of the Ice Forest, casting long shadows across the small clearing where Alfwyn knelt beside Kane's prostrate form. The old master carefully unwrapped the bandages Kieron had applied the previous night, his weathered face betraying nothing of his thoughts. Yet when he glanced up at his apprentice, the concern in his eyes spoke volumes.

The wound on Kane's side glowed with an unearthly pallor, tendrils of light spreading outward along the veins beneath his skin like branches of some ghostly tree. Where a normal wound would show signs of healing—or at least inflammation—this one seemed suspended in time, neither worsening nor improving.

"The Light Seal," Alfwyn murmured, more to himself than to Kieron. "It anchors itself to the life force, feeding upon it. Conventional healing can do little against such magic."

Kieron watched as his master applied a fresh poultice to the wound, though they both knew it would provide little relief. The young apprentice had spent the night in fitful sleep, disturbed by dreams of glowing spears and voices that whispered in languages he shouldn't understand yet somehow did.

"Will he survive?" Kieron asked again, his voice hushed in the morning stillness.

Alfwyn did not answer immediately. He finished securing the bandage, then straightened, his joints protesting audibly after the long night spent in the cold cave. He gazed southward, his brow furrowed with concentration.

"There are signs of Central Army movement from the south," he said at last, his voice grave. "And the Church is advancing from the west. We need help."

Kieron looked around the clearing, then back at Kane's pallid face. "Where can we go? Kane can't be moved in this condition."

Alfwyn's gaze shifted northward, toward the deeper reaches of the Ice Forest. "House Stark controls these lands. They have little love for either the Church or the Central Army."

As if summoned by the mention of new allies, Kane's eyes suddenly snapped open. They were clouded with pain but held a fierce determination. His hand tightened around the cloth-wrapped Light Spear at his side, never far from his grasp even in unconsciousness.

With a grunt of effort that spoke volumes about his pain, Kane struggled to sit upright. Cold sweat beaded on his forehead, but not a single complaint passed his lips. Using the wrapped spear as support, he attempted to stand, swaying dangerously but refusing to fall. A feeble light emanated from the weapon, as if responding to its master's indomitable will.

Alfwyn moved to assist him, but Kane shook his head slightly, rejecting the help. Each step he managed was a small victory, hard-won against the insidious magic working its way through his system. The knight tilted his head, listening to approaching sounds that Kieron could barely perceive, then fixed Alfwyn with a resolute stare—a wordless message that needed no translation: he would face any enemies that came.

Alfwyn nodded, understanding the knight's intentions. "We need time. House Stark might help us."

Kieron, quick to grasp the situation, stepped forward. "I'll go find them. Is there some sign they would recognize?"

Alfwyn looked mildly surprised at his apprentice's initiative, the ghost of a smile crossing his face. He reached into his pouch and produced a silver medallion bearing the sigil of a wolf. "They will recognize this."

Kieron took the medallion carefully, studying it before securing it in his inner pocket. "I saw Stark markings when we passed through the northern pine grove yesterday. I think I can find my way."

"Good observation," Alfwyn said, approval evident in his tone. "Head north until you find the lone white pine. From there, follow the Stark trail markers."

Kieron quickly prepared, selecting essential items from his satchel. "How much time do you need?"

"As much as possible, but don't get caught," Alfwyn replied, his hand falling to the knife at his belt. "Kane and I will delay them."

When Kieron hesitated, momentarily overwhelmed by the responsibility, Kane simply placed a hand on the young man's shoulder. The knight's eyes held both encouragement and command—the gaze of a man accustomed to leading others into peril.

Kieron nodded at Kane, accepting the unspoken charge. "I'll avoid the clearings where I might be spotted," he told Alfwyn. "It may take longer, but it's safer."

"Wise," Alfwyn acknowledged. "Tell House Stark that old Alfwyn needs their assistance."

Kieron cast one final glance at Kane. "Hold fast, First Knight. I'll return with help."

Without further delay, Kieron slipped away from the clearing, moving with the silent grace Alfwyn had taught him. He kept low, using the trees for cover, each step placed with deliberate care to avoid disturbing the snow and leaving obvious tracks.

From a distance, he turned back for one last look. Kane stood beside Alfwyn, his body clearly failing him but his spirit unyielding. The knight had drawn himself up to his full height, the Light Spear held before him like a standard of defiance.

Kieron felt the weight of responsibility settle upon his shoulders—not merely to find aid, but to return in time. The sounds of pursuit grew clearer now, echoing through the forest. Kane adjusted his grip on the Light Spear, and despite his wound, the steel in his eyes flashed bright—the First Knight preparing for battle once more.

Taking a deep breath, Kieron turned and disappeared into the forest, the fate of both men now resting upon the speed of his feet and the wisdom of his choices. Behind him, the morning light strengthened, catching on the falling snowflakes like countless tiny stars, witnesses to the unfolding drama beneath the ancient pines of the Ice Forest.
